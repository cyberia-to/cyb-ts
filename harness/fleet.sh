# fleet — the multi-environment proof that a cyb build actually works.
#
# Spins FLEET_N isolated bodies (each with its own HOME: fresh identity,
# fresh graph, fresh vault) against one deterministic mockchain, drives
# them with the scripted hands (CYB_SHOT / CYB_RUN / CYB_TOUR), and
# asserts on the artifacts every subsystem leaves behind:
#
#   boot      the body renders (self-shot exists, non-trivial size)
#   identity  each body minted its own mnemonic; all distinct
#   graph     attention casting grew a real graph.log
#   networks  every body reached the chain; netstate holds its height
#   beacon    bodies agree on the chain (same root observed)
#   prover    verified tickets accumulated in ~/cyb/proofs
#   vault     a sealed secret exists NOWHERE in plaintext
#   orphans   nothing we spawned outlives the fleet
#
# This is the per-commit gate: `make fleet`. It uses the debug binary and
# rebuilds only what changed. ~60-90s on a warm target dir.
#
# Env knobs: FLEET_N (bodies, default 3), FLEET_SECS (run time, default 30),
# FLEET_SKIP_BUILD=1 (trust the existing binary).
